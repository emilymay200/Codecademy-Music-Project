1) Do longer or shorter length albums tend to generate more revenue?
This groups albums by how many tracks they have by creating a temporary table called "TrackNo" that lists the number of tracks in each albums.
This then calculates the revenue for each album and groups them by how many tracks they have.

With TrackNo AS (
SELECT AlbumId, COUNT(tracks.TrackId) AS "NoOfTracks"
from tracks
GROUP BY tracks.AlbumId
)
SELECT NoOfTracks, ROUND(SUM(invoice_items.UnitPrice),3) AS "Revenue" 
from TrackNo
JOIN albums 
	ON TrackNo.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
JOIN tracks 
	ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId
JOIN invoice_items
	ON invoice_items.TrackId = tracks.TrackID
GROUP BY NoOfTracks;

2) Is the number of times a track appears in a playlist a good indicator of sales?
This indicates that it is not a good indicator of sales.

WITH PlaylistNo AS (
SELECT playlist_track.TrackId, 
	   COUNT(playlist_track.PlaylistId) AS NoPlaylists
FROM playlist_track
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT NoPlaylists, SUM(invoice_items.UnitPrice) AS "Revenue"
FROM PlaylistNo
JOIN invoice_items
ON PlaylistNo.TrackId = invoice_items.TrackId
GROUP BY 1;
